## Features
- üìä **Interactive Metrics Selection**: Users can toggle between different metrics such as Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food, Ground Service, Seat Comfort, and Value for Money.
- üåç **Geographic Analysis**: A map visualization displaying reviews by country, allowing users to filter data based on location.
- üìÖ **Time-based Trends**: A timeline visualization showcasing average ratings by month.
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Aircraft-wise Ratings**: A bar chart illustrating the average customer rating by aircraft model.
- üîé **Comprehensive Filtering Options**: Users can filter data based on traveler type, seat type, aircraft model, continent, and date.
- üìà **Summary Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed at the top for quick insights.

## Data Sources
- **CSV Files**:
  - `ba_reviews.csv`: Contains customer reviews with columns such as author, date, review location, and multiple rating categories.
  - `countries.csv`: Maps review locations to corresponding countries and continents.

## Implementation in Power BI
### 1. **Data Loading & Transformation**
- Import both CSV files into Power BI.
- Use Power Query to clean and transform data:
  - Ensure proper data types for numerical and categorical columns.
  - Create a relationship between `ba_reviews` and `countries` tables based on the `Place` and `Country` columns.

### 2. **Creating Key Metrics**
- Define **DAX Measures** for average ratings across different categories:
  ```DAX
  AverageRating = AVERAGE(ba_reviews[Rating])
  AverageCabinStaff = AVERAGE(ba_reviews[Cabin_Staff])
  AverageEntertainment = AVERAGE(ba_reviews[Entertainment])
  ```
- Create a **DAX Parameter Table** to allow users to toggle between different metrics dynamically.

### 3. **Building the Visualizations**
- **Map Visualization**:
  - Convert `Place` to a geographical data type and use a Filled Map to display reviews by country.
  - Use color gradients to represent average ratings.
- **Time Series Chart**:
  - Use a Line Chart to show monthly trends in average ratings.
  - Enable slicers for filtering by different traveler types.
- **Aircraft Ratings Bar Chart**:
  - Use a clustered bar chart to display average ratings per aircraft model.
  - Group aircraft models with fewer than 50 reviews into an "Other" category for better visualization.
- **Summary KPI Cards**:
  - Display overall average ratings using **KPI cards**.
  - Format numbers to one decimal place for readability.

### 4. **Filters & Interactivity**
- **Slicers**:
  - Implement slicers for Traveler Type, Seat Type, Aircraft Model, and Continent.
  - Ensure cross-filtering across all visuals.
- **Dynamic Titles**:
  - Use **DAX expressions** to update titles dynamically based on the selected metric.
  ```DAX
  SelectedMetricTitle = "Average " & SELECTEDVALUE(MetricTable[Metric]) & " by Country"
  ```

### 5. **Design Enhancements**
- Use a **consistent color scheme** (e.g., green for positive ratings, red for low ratings).
- Format tooltips to display both rating scores and review counts.
- Adjust axis scales and gridlines for a cleaner layout.


## Conclusion
This Power BI portfolio project demonstrates how to create a professional and interactive dashboard for analyzing customer feedback. By following best practices in data visualization and interactive filtering, this dashboard provides actionable insights for business decision-making.
